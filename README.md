# YachtaWind_wifiToNmea2000
esp32 Wifi to Nmea2000 converter

This board and firmware is just a nmea2000 converter. It converts and sends all nmea183 it recieves from a wifi tcp server to the wired Nmea2000 devices. It is powered from the NMEA2000 network
At some point i will write a guide how to use it and understand the leds.  Until then if you have questions open a discussion. 
It is build to recieve the nmea stream from original Norbert Walter's yachta wind sensor project. 
I made some minor modifications to the pcb, 3dprinted parts and software. You can find everything in my gitlab repos.

Thank you

G.
